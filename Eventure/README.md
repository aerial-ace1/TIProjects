💡 Why Tezos?
-------------

Eventure is built on Tezos, specifically its L2 solution Etherlink, for several compelling reasons:

1.  **Fast Transactions**: Tezos offers quick transaction finality
2.  **Fair & Affordable**: Nearly free gas fees make it accessible for all users
3.  **Solidity Compatibility**: Etherlink allows writing smart contracts in Solidity
4.  **Tezos Features**: Leverages Tezos' underlying features without compromise

🔒 Why On-Chain? Prioritizing User Data Security
------------------------------------------------

Building Eventure on-chain is a strategic decision to enhance user data security and trust:

1.  **Immutability**: On-chain data cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring the integrity of event records and user interactions.
2.  **Transparency**: All transactions and data changes are visible on the blockchain, allowing for easy auditing and verification.
3.  **Decentralization**: No single entity controls the data, reducing the risk of centralized data breaches.
4.  **Self-Sovereignty**: Users have full control over their data and digital assets (like NFT tickets).
5.  **Enhanced Privacy**: While transparent, blockchain technology allows for pseudonymous interactions, protecting user identities.
6.  **Smart Contract Security**: Automated, trustless execution of event logic reduces the risk of fraud or manipulation.
7.  **Interoperability**: On-chain data can easily integrate with other blockchain-based services, expanding the ecosystem.

By leveraging blockchain technology, Eventure ensures that user data and event information remain secure, tamper-proof, and under the control of the users themselves.

🎯 Target Audience
------------------

1.  **Event Attendees**: Regular event-goers looking for a streamlined experience
2.  **Event Organizers**: Community managers seeking efficient event management solutions
